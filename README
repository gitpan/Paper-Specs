Paper::Specs
============

A module to provide general purpose access to specifications on paper stock, labels and other
well known print media.

This module will make it easier for you to:

 - Layout PDF and PostScript documents
 - Obtain page size information
 - Support page sizes you didn't know about

It is designed to be simple and easy to use. It does not use any parser or load extensive amounts
of data into memory. Instead I am taking the approach of DateTime::Timezone where each individual 
specification is its own class. These classes are loaded as requested by you the developer. :)

STATUS
======

This is just a draft. I am confonted with a few issues before I can actually flesh out the 
specifications for a multitude of different forms:

 - the specification storage format may change so I don't want to do a lot
   of unnecessary coding at this pont

Paper::Specs was originally written by Jay Lawrence and is now maintained by Jon Allen (JJ).
