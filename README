Paper::Specs
============

A module to provide general purpose access to specifications on paper stock, labels and other
well known print media.

This module will make it easier for you to:

 - Layout PDF and PostScript documents
 - Obtain page size information
 - Support page sizes you didn't know about

It is designed to be simple and easy to use. It does not use any parser or load extensive amounts
of data into memory. Instead I am taking the approach of DateTime::Timezone where each individual 
specification is its own class. These classes are loaded as requested by you the developer. :)

STATUS
======

This is just a draft. I am confonted with a few issues before I can actually flesh out the 
specifications for a multitude of different forms:

 - a non-technical issue regarding a well known label supplier
 - the specification storage format may change so I don't want to do a lot
   of unnecessary coding at this pont
 - I am presenting this code along with a few other modules at YAPC::Canada which is
   two days from now and I need to get ready

Please send your feedback good or bad to jlawrenc@cpan.org

Thanks!
